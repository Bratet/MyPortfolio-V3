I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. I specialize in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, creating solutions that extract meaningful value from complex data at Artefact, where I help clients transform their raw data into actionable insights.

My technical foundation extends beyond AIâ€”I have strong skills in software engineering, algorithms, information theory, and graph theory, allowing me to approach problems from multiple angles and develop robust solutions.

I thrive on new challenges and continuously seek innovative approaches to solving complex problems. Whether it's a freelance opportunity, a collaboration, or simply a conversation about artificial intelligence, I welcome connections through email or LinkedIn.
